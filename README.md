*Spring Pure XML* is an utility project which _expands_ Spring's XML
configurations using "Appendix E. XML Schema-based configuration" (from Spring
Framework reference documentation) mechanisms.

Plan:
- [ ] read XML config (with XSD based configuration) with special ParserContext
- [ ] write _pure_ XML config (with XSD constructs _expanded_)
- [ ] CLI utility
- [ ] _expand_ @Configuration configs
- [ ] Eclipse/STS plugin
